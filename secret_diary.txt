DEAR DIARY
==========

twilight says computers have like thousands of ports and i was like WOAH thats so many doors!!!

i asked her what port 4443 does and she said its for "secure stuff" and i said PERFECT thats where ill put my secret recipes!!!

"the rock formation at coordinates 40.7128, -74.0060 is limestone"
